# PageRank
University project (Iterative Methods Application)

The project was presented on an Algebra course (5th Semester in the Informatics Engineering career at Yachay Tech University). The project
is a basic algorithm implementation of PageRank. It shows you how the Power Method is useful in order to compute eigenvalues
and get the most popular page in a web example.

The program is written on C and in order to have the program running, you need an additional .txt file with the information about 
your web example. For more information, please read the resume.pdf.
